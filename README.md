## **🚀 nf-core Hackathon**

Welcome to the nf-core Hackathon repository! This event is a collaborative and community-driven coding sprint where bioinformaticians, developers, and enthusiasts come together to contribute to nf-core workflows and pipelines. Whether you're a first-time participant or an experienced developer, there's a place for you to make an impact. 🎯

## **🔥 How the Hackathon Works**

Unlike traditional hackathons, the nf-core hackathons are not competitive. Instead, they are designed to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing. Participants work together on various projects, which can range from:

Enhancing existing nf-core pipelines 🛠️

Developing entirely new workflows 🔬

Fixing bugs and improving documentation 📝

Addressing open issues from the nf-core community 💡


## **🎉 Let's Hack Together!**

nf-core hackathons thrive on collaboration and innovation. Whether you're improving existing tools or building something entirely new, your contributions matter. Let's make an impact, together!

Happy hacking! 🚀
